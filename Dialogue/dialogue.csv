##NOTE_WORKSHOP_001##;For your information:\nAll tools moved to new workshop.
##NOTE_WORKSHOP_002##;Only blueprints and interior in this room.
##NOTE_WORKSHOP_003##;Key is safely stored in the deep.
##NOTE_ROOTMIMIC_001##;Please respect the space of every growing being. Nature will protect itself.
##NOTE_BASEMENT_OVERGROWN_001##;Do not cut what is not in your way. Do not kill what need not die.
##NOTE_MANTRA_001##;Grow into the better you.
##NOTE_FOREST_BED_001##;Fren's treehouse.
##NOTE_FOREST_BED_002##;The wood in this area is unique. Sturdy and pale.\nI will bring some to the new place.
##NOTE_FOREST_BED_003##;I used it for the bed. I can make a blueprint, so do not take it.
##NOTE_FOREST_BED_004##;It was really hard to get up here.
##FROG_INTRO_001##;Did you just come in?
##FROG_INTRO_002##;I thought applications were closed...\nNo matter. Welcome to the farm!
##FROG_INTRO_003##;I understand that everything here is new for you, so consider me your supervisor.
##FROG_INTRO_004##;Now for your first task...
##FROG_INTRO_005##;Take this seed, plant it, and come back to me with the crop.
##FROG_INTRO_REPEAT_001##;I gave you a seed. Plant it, and wait for it to grow.
##FROG_INTRO_REPEAT_002##;Bring me the crop once it has fully grown.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_001##;Excellent!\nLooks like you will be good at this in no time.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_002##;We've been storing seeds down in the basement.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_003##;Here is the key.\nLet's see you grow a few more crops.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_004##;Oh also, I shouldn't have to say this but, uh...\nLet the wild life be, alright?
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_REPEAT_001##;We've been storing seeds down in the basement.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_REPEAT_002##;Go collect some, and grow a few more crops.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_REPEAT_003##;Don't get lost down there.
##FROG_FARM_MESS_001##;Great work!
##FROG_FARM_MESS_002##;This farm is in a bit of disarray.\nTake those planks and make another plant box for yourself.
##FROG_FARM_MESS_003##;With this kind of progress you're shaping up to be employee of the month!
##FROG_FARM_MESS_004##;If only... that title existed anymore.
##FROG_FARM_MESS_005##;Unfortunately things have changed a bit, as you saw down there. It's a bit of a mess.
##FROG_FARM_MESS_006##;But messes are only here until someone cleans them up.\nSo let's get to work!
##FROG_BLUEPRINT_WEEDCUTTER_001##;I'm sure you've noticed. Nature here is slightly... bigger.
##FROG_BLUEPRINT_WEEDCUTTER_002##;Plants grow at explosive rates, and wildlife adapts in turn.
##FROG_BLUEPRINT_WEEDCUTTER_003##;There's a forest near here, the basement connects to it. Only it's been some time since anyone's been through there.
##FROG_BLUEPRINT_WEEDCUTTER_004##;If we could gain entrance then the mines won't be far, and the...\nWe'd have all the materials we need!
##FROG_BLUEPRINT_WEEDCUTTER_005##;We'll need a tool to cut our way through. Try and look for something, like a workshop, down there.
##FROG_BLUEPRINT_WEEDCUTTER_REPEAT_001##;You'll need a tool to cut your way into the forest.
##FROG_BLUEPRINT_WEEDCUTTER_REPEAT_002##;Look for a workshop down there. Maybe they left some things behind.
