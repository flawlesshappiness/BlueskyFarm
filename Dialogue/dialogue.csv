##NOTE_FOREST_BED_001##;Fren's treehouse.
##NOTE_FOREST_BED_002##;The wood in this area is unique. Sturdy and pale.\nI will bring some to the new place.
##NOTE_FOREST_BED_003##;I used it for the bed. I can make a blueprint, so do not take it.
##NOTE_FOREST_BED_004##;It was really hard to get up here.
##NOTE_BUSINESS_NAMES_001##;It's a list of names. All stricken through, except for the last one.
##NOTE_BUSINESS_NAMES_002##;Grow-Good Veggies\nGrow-Good Farm
##NOTE_BUSINESS_NAMES_003##;Big Growth Farm\nVeggies from the rift
##NOTE_BUSINESS_NAMES_004##;Riftwood Farm
##FROG_INTRO_001##;Welcome to the farm!\nYou can call me Fren.
##FROG_INTRO_002##;I've been assigned as your supervisor, and will be the one to give you your introductory tasks.
##FROG_INTRO_003##;I understand that everything here is new for you, so let's start with something simple.
##FROG_INTRO_004##;Take this seed, plant it, and come back to me with the crop.
##FROG_INTRO_REPEAT_001##;I gave you a seed. Plant it, and wait for it to grow.
##FROG_INTRO_REPEAT_002##;Bring me the crop once it has fully grown.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_001##;Excellent!\nLooks like you will be good at this in no time.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_002##;We used to store seeds down in the basement.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_003##;Here is the key.\nLet's see you grow a few more crops.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_004##;Oh also, I shouldn't have to say this but, uh...\nLet the wild life be, alright?
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_REPEAT_001##;We used to store seeds down in the basement.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_REPEAT_002##;Go collect some, and grow a few more crops.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_REPEAT_003##;Don't get lost down there.
##FROG_FARM_MESS_001##;Great work!
##FROG_FARM_MESS_002##;This farm is in a bit of disarray.\nTake those planks and make another plant box for yourself.
##FROG_FARM_MESS_003##;Then we will talk about your next task.
##FROG_BLUEPRINT_WEEDCUTTER_001##;Listen, to tell you the truth...
##FROG_BLUEPRINT_WEEDCUTTER_002##;This whole company thing...\nIt's kind of on pause right now.
##FROG_BLUEPRINT_WEEDCUTTER_003##;Someone was a little lax during the hiring process.\nEnded up letting in some nasty people. Real nasty...
##FROG_BLUEPRINT_WEEDCUTTER_004##;I think there's a way we can deal with this issue, but I'm going to need your help.\nFrom the basement there is a way into the forest, but it might be heavily overgrown.
##FROG_BLUEPRINT_WEEDCUTTER_005##;We'll need a tool to cut our way through. Try and look for something, like a workshop, down there.
##FROG_BLUEPRINT_WEEDCUTTER_REPEAT_001##;You'll need a tool to cut your way into the forest.
##FROG_BLUEPRINT_WEEDCUTTER_REPEAT_002##;Look for a workshop down there. Maybe they left some things behind.
##FROG_WEEDCUTTER_CREATE_001##;Good work out there. Let's get that weedcutter crafted, so that you can proceed to the forest.
##FROG_FOREST_ENTER_001##;Excellent!\nWith this you can cut your way through the overgrowth.
##FROG_FOREST_ENTER_002##;There's a mine entrance in the forest, where you will be able to find most of the material we are going to need.
##FROG_FOREST_ENTER_003##;Those nasty people have also settled in a building near the forest. Try to avoid a confrontation.
##FROG_FOREST_ENTER_REPEAT_001##;There's a mine entrace in the forest. We are going to need the materials from there.
##FROG_FOREST_ENTER_REPEAT_002##;If you get lost, try to look for signs. They will point you in the right direction.
##FROG_SEEDS_AUTO_GROW_001##;Seeds will grow, even while you're down there collecting more.\nSo you don't have to hang around here waiting.
##FROG_SEEDS_AUTO_GROW_002##;Not that I don't enjoy your company...
##FROG_FIRST_DEATH_001##;Woah, you're looking worse for wear.\nYou alright?
##FROG_FIRST_DEATH_002##;Listen, most things down there don't want nothing to do with you. Try to keep distance and you should be good.
