##NOTE_WORKSHOP_001##;Since everyone is gone, we're locking up and leaving this place.
##NOTE_WORKSHOP_002##;There's only blueprints and interior in this room. Frida has the key.

##NOTE_ROOTMIMIC_001##;I don't care if you're getting seeds or storing produce.\STAY AWAY from the critters.
##NOTE_ROOTMIMIC_002##;They WILL grab you if you get too close.

##NOTE_FOREST_BED_001##;Fren's treehouse.
##NOTE_FOREST_BED_002##;The wood in this area is unique. Sturdy and pale.\nI will bring some to the new place.
##NOTE_FOREST_BED_003##;I used it for the bed. I can make a blueprint, so do not take it.
##NOTE_FOREST_BED_004##;It was really hard to get up here.
##NOTE_BUSINESS_NAMES_001##;A list of names. All stricken through, except for the last one.
##NOTE_BUSINESS_NAMES_002##;Grow-Good Veggies\nGrow-Good Farm
##NOTE_BUSINESS_NAMES_003##;Big Growth Farm\nVeggies from the rift

##FROG_INTRO_001##;Hello!\nAre you new?
##FROG_INTRO_002##;I thought we stopped getting new people.\nI can be your supervisor, I guess.
##FROG_INTRO_003##;Everything here is probably all new for you, so let's start with something simple.
##FROG_INTRO_004##;Take this seed, plant it, and come back to me with the crop.
##FROG_INTRO_REPEAT_001##;I gave you a seed. Plant it, and wait for it to grow.
##FROG_INTRO_REPEAT_002##;Bring me the crop once it has fully grown.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_001##;Excellent!\nLooks like you will be good at this in no time.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_002##;We used to store seeds down in the basement.\nHere is the key.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_REPEAT_001##;We used to store seeds down in the basement.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_REPEAT_002##;The crops will grow while you're down there so go collect more seeds.
##FROG_DESTROY_TREE_001##;Good job!\nLooks like you are ready.
##FROG_DESTROY_TREE_002##;Now you must destroy the holy tree, at the old burial grounds. Everyone who used to work here were killed by its worshippers.
##FROG_DESTROY_TREE_003##;Only a special weapon will do. A sword of forged from a crystal mold.
##FROG_DESTROY_TREE_004##;Good luck!
##FROG_DESTROY_TREE_REPEAT_001##;The holy tree grows inside a building in the forest past the basement.
##FROG_DESTROY_TREE_REPEAT_002##;Only a special sword forged from a crystal mold can cut into the core of the holy tree.
##FROG_DESTROY_TREE_REPEAT_003##;You must forge the sword, then slay the tree.
##FROG_FOREST_WEEDS_001##;Have you run into any obstructions?
##FROG_FOREST_WEEDS_002##;I'm sure you've noticed that plants, among other things, grow quite large.
##FROG_FOREST_WEEDS_003##;If you can't remove them by hand, try looking for a tool in the old workshop, down there.
##FROG_STONE_001##;You found the mine? That's great! We need those crystals in order to craft the sword mold.
##FROG_STONE_002##;Unfortunately, rocks don't pop open and spit out their innards if you ask them nicely.
##FROG_STONE_003##;There must be a pickaxe left behind down there, after they all left.
##FROG_FORGE_001##;I never liked the forge in the mines. Someone else was assigned to those, not me.
##FROG_FORGE_002##;I remember they were carrying coal for the furnace, try that.
##FROG_CORE_001##;So you've seen the holy tree. Did you reach the core?
##FROG_CORE_002##;Just jump in the hole, we do it all the time. It's easy to climb out again.
##FROG_FIRST_DEATH_001##;Woah, you're looking worse for wear.\nYou alright?
##FROG_FIRST_DEATH_002##;Listen, most things down there don't want nothing to do with you. Try to keep your distance.
