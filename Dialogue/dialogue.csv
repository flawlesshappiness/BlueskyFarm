##FROG_INTRO_001##;Did you just come in?
##FROG_INTRO_002##;I thought we closed applications... No matter. Welcome to the farm!
##FROG_INTRO_003##;I understand that everything here is new for you, so you can consider me your supervisor.
##FROG_INTRO_004##;Now for your first task...
##FROG_INTRO_005##;Take this seed, plant it, and come back to me with the crop.
##FROG_INTRO_REPEAT_001##;I gave you a seed. Plant it, and wait for it to grow.
##FROG_INTRO_REPEAT_002##;Bring me the crop once it has fully grown.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_001##;Excellent!\nLooks like you will be good at this in no time.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_002##;We've been storing seeds down in the basement.
##FROG_FIND_SEEDS_003##;Here is the key.\nLet's see you grow a few more crops.
